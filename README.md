# SwiftAI

A modern, type-safe Swift library for building AI-powered apps. SwiftAI provides a unified API that works seamlessly across different AI models - from Apple's on-device models to cloud-based services like OpenAI.

## Quick Start

```swift
import SwiftAI

let llm = SystemLLM()
let response = try await llm.reply(to: "What is the capital of France?")
print(response.content) // "Paris"
```

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

**Xcode:**

1. Go to **File → Add Package Dependencies**
2. Enter: `https://github.com/mi12labs/SwiftAI`
3. Click **Add Package**

**Package.swift (Non Xcode):**

```swift
dependencies: [
  .package(url: "https://github.com/mi12labs/SwiftAI", from: "main")
]
```

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Your First AI Query

Start with the simplest possible example - just ask a question and get an answer:

```swift
import SwiftAI

// Initialize Apple's on-device language model.
let llm = SystemLLM()

// Ask a question and get a response.
let response = try await llm.reply(to: "What is the capital of France?")
print(response.content) // "Paris"
```

**What just happened?**

- `SystemLLM()` creates Apple's on-device AI model
- `reply(to:)` sends your question and returns a `String` by default
- `try await` handles the asynchronous AI processing
- The response is wrapped in a `response` object - use `.content` to get the actual text

### Step 2: Structured Responses

Instead of getting plain text, let's get structured data that your app can use directly:

```swift
// Define the structure you want back
@Generable
struct CityInfo {
  let name: String
  let country: String
  let population: Int
}

let response = try await llm.reply(
  to: "Tell me about Tokyo",
  returning: CityInfo.self // Tell the LLM what to output
)

let cityInfo = response.content
print(cityInfo.name)       // "Tokyo"
print(cityInfo.country)    // "Japan"
print(cityInfo.population) // 13960000
```

**What's new here?**

- `@Generable` tells SwiftAI this struct can be generated by AI
- `returning: CityInfo.self` specifies you want structured data, not a string
- SwiftAI automatically converts the AI's response into your struct
- No JSON parsing required!

#### 💡 Key Concept: Type-Safe AI

SwiftAI ensures the AI returns data in exactly the format your code expects. If the AI can't generate valid data, you'll get an error instead of broken data.

### Step 3: Tool Use

Let your AI call functions in your app to get real-time information:

```swift
// Create a tool the AI can use
struct WeatherTool: Tool {
  let description = "Get current weather for a city"

  @Generable
  struct Arguments {
    let city: String
  }

  func call(arguments: Arguments) async throws -> String {
    // Your weather API logic here
    return "It's 72°F and sunny in \(arguments.city)"
  }
}

// Use the tool with your AI
let weatherTool = WeatherTool()
let response = try await llm.reply(
    to: "What's the weather like in San Francisco?",
    tools: [weatherTool]
)
print(response.content) // "Based on current data, it's 72°F and sunny in San Francisco"
```

**What's new here?**

- `Tool` protocol lets you create functions the AI can call
- `Arguments` struct defines what parameters your tool needs (also `@Generable`)
- The AI automatically decides when to call your tool
- You get back a natural language response that incorporates the tool's data

#### 💡 Key Concept: AI Function Calling

The AI reads your tool's description and automatically decides whether to call it. You don't manually trigger tools - the AI does it when needed.

### Step 4: Model Switching

Different AI models have different strengths. SwiftAI makes switching seamless:

```swift
// Choose your model based on availability
let llm: any LLM = {
  let systemLLM = SystemLLM()
  return systemLLM.isAvailable ? systemLLM : OpenaiLLM(apiKey: "your-api-key")
}()

// Same code works with any model
let response = try await llm.reply(to: "Write a haiku about Berlin.")
print(response.content)
```

**What's new here?**

- `SystemLLM` runs on-device (private, fast, free)
- `OpenaiLLM` uses the cloud (more capable, requires API key)
- `isAvailable` checks if the on-device model is ready
- Same `reply()` method works with any LLM

#### 💡 Key Concept: Model Agnostic API

Your code doesn't change when you switch models. This lets you optimize for different scenarios (privacy, capabilities, cost) without rewriting your app.

### Step 5: Conversations

For multi-turn conversations, use `Chat` to maintain context across messages:

```swift
// Create a chat with tools
let chat = try Chat(with: llm, tools: [weatherTool])

// Have a conversation
let greeting = try await chat.send("Hello! I'm planning a trip.")
let advice = try await chat.send("What should I pack for Seattle?")
// The AI remembers context from previous messages
```

**What's new here?**

- `Chat` maintains conversation history automatically
- `send()` is like `reply()` but remembers previous messages
- Tools work in conversations too
- The AI remembers context from earlier in the conversation

#### 💡 Key Concept: Stateful vs Stateless

- `reply()` is stateless - each call is independent
- `Chat` is stateful - builds on previous conversation

### Step 6: Advanced Constraints

Add validation rules and descriptions to guide AI generation:

```swift
@Generable
struct UserProfile {
  @Guide(description: "A valid username starting with a letter", .pattern("^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_]{2,}$"))
  let username: String

  @Guide(description: "User age in years", .minimum(13), .maximum(120))
  let age: Int

  @Guide(description: "One to three favorite colors", .minimumCount(1), .maximumCount(3))
  let favoriteColors: [String]
}
```

**What's new here?**

- `@Guide` adds constraints and descriptions to fields which help LLM generate good content
- `.pattern()` tells the LLM to follow a regex
- `.minimum()` and `.maximum()` constrain numbers
- `.minimumCount()` and `.maximumCount()` control array sizes

#### 💡 Key Concept: Validated Generation

Constraints ensure the AI follows your business rules.

### Locall AI using MLX (Experimental)

The MLX backend provides access to local language models through [Apple's MLX](https://opensource.apple.com/projects/mlx/) framework.

**Setup:**

```swift
// Add SwiftAIMLX to your target in Package.swift
targets: [
  .target(
    name: "YourTarget",
    dependencies: [
      .product(name: "SwiftAI", package: "SwiftAI"),
      .product(name: "SwiftAIMLX", package: "SwiftAI")  // 👈 Add this
    ]
  )
]
```

**Usage:**

```swift
import SwiftAI
import SwiftAIMLX
import MLXLLM

// The model manager handles MLX models within an app instance.
// Responsibilities:
// - Downloading models from Hugging Face (if not already on disk)
// - Caching model weights in memory
// - Sharing model weights across the app instance
let modelManager = MlxModelManager(storageDirectory: .documentsDirectory)

// Create an LLM with a specific configuration.
// Available configurations are listed in `LLMRegistry` (from MLXLLM).
//
// If the model is not yet available locally, it will be automatically
// downloaded from Hugging Face on first use.
let llm = modelManager.llm(withConfiguration: LLMRegistry.gemma3n_E2B_it_lm_4bit)

// Use the same API as with other LLM backends.
let response = try await llm.reply(to: "Hello!")
print(response.content)
```

**Note:** Structured output generation is not yet supported with MLX models.
