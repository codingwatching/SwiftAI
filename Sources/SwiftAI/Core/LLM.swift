  ///
  /// This method sends a conversation history to the language model along with available tools
  /// and returns a structured response of the specified type. The model can use the provided
  /// tools during generation to access external data or perform computations.
  ///
  /// - Parameters:
  ///   - messages: The conversation history to send to the LLM. Must end with a user message.
  ///   - tools: An array of tools available for the LLM to use during generation
  ///   - type: The expected return type conforming to `Generable`
  ///   - options: Configuration options for the LLM request
  /// - Returns: An `LLMReply` containing the generated response and conversation history

  ///
  /// ## Important
  ///
  /// The conversation history must end with a user message. The LLM will use all previous messages
  /// as context and respond to the final user message.
  ///
  /// ## Usage Example
  ///
  /// ```swift
  /// let messages = [
  ///   .system(.init(text: "You are a helpful assistant")),
  ///   .user(.init(text: "What's the weather like?"))
  /// ]
  /// let tools = [weatherTool, calculatorTool]
  /// let reply = try await llm.reply(
  ///   to: messages,
  ///   returning: WeatherReport.self,
  ///   tools: [weatherTool, calculatorTool],
  ///   options: .default
  /// )
  /// print("Temperature: \(reply.content.temperature)Â°C")
